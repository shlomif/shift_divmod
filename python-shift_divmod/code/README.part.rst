PURPOSE
=======

This distribution implements faster divmod() (and ``.mod()``) operations
for moduli with a large number of trailing 0 bits (where the div/mod base
is divisible by ``2 ** n`` for an integer `n`).

It should yield the same result as the built-n divmod() function for
positive numerators (its behaviour for negative ones is currently
untested and undefined).

Also provided is a port to C and gmplib (= GNU multiple precision):
https://github.com/shlomif/shift_divmod/tree/master/gmp-shift_divmod

INSTALLATION
============

pip3 install shift_divmod

USAGE
=====

::

    from shift_divmod import ShiftDivMod

    base = 997
    shift = 1200
    modder = ShiftDivMod(base, shift)
    # Alternative constructor which may require more
    # work and eventualy calls the default constructor
    modder = ShiftDivMod.from_int(base << shift)

    x = 10 ** 500
    # Same as divmod(x, (base << shift))
    print( modder.divmod(x) )

NOTES
=====

The code from which this distribution has been derived, was proposed as a
proof-of-concept for a potential improvement for the built in cpython3
operations here: https://bugs.python.org/issue41487 . However, changing cpython3
in this manner was rejected.

libdivide ( https://github.com/ridiculousfish/libdivide ) provides a
different, but also interesting, approach for optimizing division.

BENCHMARKS:

On my system, I got these results after running
``python3 code/examples/shift_divmod_example.py bench`` (reformated
for clarity):

As can be noticed the shift_divmod based versions are over 4 times faster than
GMP and much faster than the builtinops which only completed 25 out of 1,000 iterations
before being interrupted. Note that for that use case, using GMP's modular exponentiation
seems even faster.

With the C and gmplib version:

- ``mpz_mod`` runs the benchmark in about 160 seconds.
- ``shift_divmod`` runs the benchmark in about 35 seconds.
- ``pypy3`` runs the pure-Python code in 25 seconds (!).

The Secret Sauce:
-----------------

The code utilises the fact that `bitwise operations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation>`_
are fast, and the magic happens in this code:

::

    def divmod(self, inp):
        """calculate divmod(inp, self.n)"""
        if inp < self.n:
            return 0, inp
        div, mod = divmod((inp >> self.shift), self.base)
        return div, ((mod << self.shift) | (inp & self.mask))

(Or the equivalent but more bureaucratic C and gmplib code.)

Note that ``self.mask`` is precalculated to be
``((1 << self.shift) - 1)``.
